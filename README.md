# Space-Shooter
Here's a Space Shooter game.
To start - either run bin/project1.exe or open the project1.sln in Microsoft VS and run the project in release mode (to ensure more stable FPS).

In game, press "H' to access developer menu and test things around. The collisions works great with the sprites off. With sprites - there is minor computational overhead and the collision detection suffers to perform it's best.
